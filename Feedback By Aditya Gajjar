I am ADITYA GAJJAR and I tested the app of DANNI HUANG.
The Min and Target versions of the SDKs are 19 and 28. 
I tested the app on a phone (One Plus 6) with Android OS 9.0(Pie). 
The app does not crash.
The app does display:
Hello DANNI HUANG
And
Welcome in CS 639 Summer 2019

The name of the student is displayed.
